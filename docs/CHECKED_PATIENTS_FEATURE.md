# Checked Patients Feature

## Overview
This feature ensures that only patients whose appointments have been marked as "checked" or "completed" by the doctor are visible in the Patients page.

## How it Works

### 1. Appointment Checking Process
- In the **Appointments** page (`/doctor-dashboard/appointment`), doctors can mark patients as "checked"
- When a doctor clicks "Check Patient", the appointment status is updated to "checked"
- The system also sets a `checkedAt` timestamp for tracking

### 2. Patients Page Filtering
- The **Patients** page (`/doctor-dashboard/patients`) only displays patients whose appointments have status "checked" or "completed"
- This is handled by the API endpoint `/api/doctor/patients` which filters bookings by status
- Only patients the doctor has actually seen/checked appear in this list

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Update Appointment Status
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/doctor/appointments/[id]`
- **Purpose**: Updates appointment status to "checked" when doctor checks a patient
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "status": "checked",
    "notes": "Patient checked by doctor"
  }
  ```

#### Get Checked Patients
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/doctor/patients`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves only patients with "checked" or "completed" status
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `search`: Search by patient name, phone, or email
  - `status`: Filter by specific status
  - `page`: Pagination
  - `limit`: Number of results per page

### 4. Database Schema
The `bookingModel` includes:
- `status`: String enum with values including "checked", "completed"
- `checked`: Boolean field for backward compatibility
- `checkedAt`: Timestamp when patient was checked

### 5. User Interface
- **Appointments Page**: Shows all appointments with "Check Patient" button
- **Patients Page**: Shows only checked patients with clear indicators
- Visual indicators show which patients have been checked
- Statistics cards reflect only checked patients

## Benefits
1. **Privacy**: Doctors only see patients they have actually treated
2. **Organization**: Clear separation between pending and treated patients
3. **Compliance**: Ensures proper patient-doctor relationship tracking
4. **Analytics**: Accurate statistics based on actual patient interactions

## Technical Implementation
- Frontend uses Zustand store for state management
- Backend uses MongoDB with proper indexing
- JWT authentication ensures doctor-specific data access
- Real-time updates with optimistic UI updates
